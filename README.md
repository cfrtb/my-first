my-first
========

Using WP-Forge and WP-Starter, creating my own SASS version of Foundation and Wordpress. The following are included here:

-- customized functions.php for woocommerce
-- the woocommerce 2.1 template files
-- SASS 

As the project goes on I will be adding skeleton files that are continously being used.

This project does require Wordpress (as of this writing 3.8.1) and WP-Forge.
